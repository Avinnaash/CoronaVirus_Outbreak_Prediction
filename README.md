# CapstoneProject
 Covid-19 Outbreak Prediction Using Machine Learning using the Datasets upto 25th March.

 Its 25th March Afternoon and India has reported its 9th death with 562 total confirmed cases due to COVID-19. Fresh cases from Manipur, Bihar, Gujrat, and Madhya Pradhesh have been reported by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

We need a strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the spread of the virus in the next 7 days.

This Model prediction might not be 100% accurate but it predict the flow of spread of virus infection.

# Libraries used: 

#       For Data Manipulation
        import pandas as pd

#       Visualisation libraries
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        %matplotlib inline 
        import seaborn as sns
        import plotly.express as px
        import plotly.graph_objects as go
        import folium 
        from folium import plugins

#       Manipulating the default plot size
        plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 10, 12

#       Disable warnings 
        import warnings
        warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Why Folium used?

Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega visualizations as markers on the map.

# Symptoms of Corona

    COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and

        11.a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes
##  Serious symptoms:
        1. difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
        2. chest pain or pressure
        3. loss of speech or movement
